# JavaScript Simple Algorithms #

The most frequently asked JS questions in technical interviews.

* ### Cumulative Sum ###
Solving basic algorithms with plain JavaScript 
Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a number that is the sum of all values in the array.

* ###  Binary Search ###
Create a function that takes a sorted array and a target value. Return the index of the target value in the array. If the target value is not in the array, return -1.

* ### Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache ###

- Initialize an object with a maxium capacity of elements.
- getItem Return the value of the key. Update cache with the most recently used key.
- putItem Create or update a key value pair in the cache. Evict the least recently used key if the size of keys exceeds the max capacity.
